# El coco

This is a simple app made with electronjs and cocos-creator.

## Running

To run use
> npm install
> npm start

## Building

To build I recomend you use the [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager).

If use this, install the **electron-packager** globaly and run:

> npm install
> electron-packager . elcoco --platform=win32 --arch=x64

If you are running in another OS, please read the documentation of **electron-packager**.

## Thanks

It's was using the [First tutorial](https://github.com/cocos-creator/tutorial-first-game) to build the web desktop game.
